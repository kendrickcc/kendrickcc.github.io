These are 360째 interactive panoramas I've created. Most were photographed using a drone. The home virtual tour was created using a Sony a7R series camera with a [TTArttisan 11mm ED F2.8 fisheye lens](https://www.ttartisan.com/?list_9/78.html). A very inexpensive lens that is a lot of fun to shoot with.

The images were initially edited in Adobe Bridge/Photoshop to adjust white balance and adjust exposure as needed. Then combined using [PTGui Pro](https://ptgui.com). I prefer the Pro version as it will handle RAW formats. The panorama is created and exported into cubes. The cubes are then brough back into Photoshop and edited, particularly the zenith and nadir shots. They are combined again in PTGui to create the final panorama.

The panorama is then loaded into [Marzipano tool](https://www.marzipano.net/tool/) to create the tour. The tour is exported and then uploaded to a server for viewing.

These links will open up in a new window, and points to Microsoft Azure resources.
