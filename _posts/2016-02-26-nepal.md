**Code for Nepal  Launches _<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=whoisnepali&src=typd" target="_blank">#WhoIsNepali</a>_ Video and Photo Competition for Rs. 75,000**

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Washington, D.C.</strong> &#8211; Today the non-profit Code for Nepal launched a video and photo competition with an award amount of 55,000 Nepali Rupees. The competition is titled “<em><strong>Ko Nepali</strong></em>?,” which translates to “Who is a Nepali?” The competition aims to recognize digital literacy skills and facilitate conversation about who is a Nepali and what it means to be a Nepali, while strengthening a culture of creativity and civic debate online. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>For details on eligibility and rules about the competition, check out this page:</strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://codefornepal.org/nepali"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.codefornepal.org/nepali</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></span></span>

Code for Nepal seeks short video entries for the competition (180 seconds or less), or photos, from amateur videographers and photographers living in Nepal or abroad, who are 14 or older. Videos can be submitted in Bhojpuri, English, Maithili, Nepali, or Tamang.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The contest will accept submissions from March 25, 2016 to April 25, 2016. Submissions will be accepted via </span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://codefornepal.org/nepali"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.codefornepal.org/nepali</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span> Details of the application will be announced in late March via Code for Nepal website.</span>

“The selection will be based on originality and clarity of the message,” says Roshan Ghimire, Partnership and Media Manager at Code for Nepal. “We won’t judge based solely on the quality of production, and we are encouraging amateur photographers and videographers to submit.”

Winners will be announced on June 15, 2016. The first prize winner for video will receive Rs. 25,000 and the first prize winner for photo will receive Rs. 10,000. There will also be cash prizes for second and third places.

In total, Code for Nepal will grant cash prizes to 10 applicants.

“In addition to increasing awareness about digital literacy, we hope this competition will foster dialogue among people from various backgrounds and regions in Nepal about their identity, and how their unique attributes define them equally as Nepalis,” says Ghimire.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Code for Nepal is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization registered in the United States. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Code for Nepal works to increase digital literacy and the use of open data in Nepal.</span>
