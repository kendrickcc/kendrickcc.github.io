Women make up more than [half the population](https://nepalmap.org/profiles/country-NP-nepal/#demographics) of Nepal today and they will continue to be the majority of [Nepal in 2030](https://nepalmap.org/profiles/country-NP-nepal/#demographics) too!

  


## To mark the 2018 International Women&#8217;s Day,  here are six data visualizations to show the status of women in Nepal.

&nbsp;

### 

### <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><b>The proportion of employed women has decreased</b></em></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The proportion of women who were employed was only 68% in 2016 compared to 83% in 2006. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Among employed respondents, women are almost three times more likely than men not to be paid (52% versus 16%),” according to the <a href="https://www.dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR336/FR336.pdf">demographic and health survey</a> (PDF) by the Government of Nepal. </span>



### _<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Spousal violence has decreased </b></span>_

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One in four women in Nepal experienced spousal violence in 2016. While that number is very high, it has declined since 2011 when 32% of women or one in three experienced spousal violence. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Spousal violence in the Terai region is high compared to other regions. One in three women in the Terai reported spousal violence.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women in Province 2 (37%) are most likely to experience spousal physical, sexual, or emotional violence, and those in Province 4 (16%) least likely to do so. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Explore the map to see the level of spousal violence by Provinces in Nepal. </span>



### <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>More women agree that wife beating is justified </em></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">More than one in four women agree that wife beating is justified under a specific circumstance. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“The proportion of women who consider wife beating justifiable under specific circumstances increased from 23% in 2006 to 29% in 2016. The proportion among men increased marginally, from 21% to 23%.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Women living in “Province 2 (33%) and Province 7 (34%) are most likely to have attitudes justifying wife beating under any one specific circumstance.”</span>

Explore the map below to see the attitude of women towards wife beating in Provinces of Nepal



### _<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Proportion of seats held by women in national parliament of Nepal remains unchanged</b></span>_

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, proportion of seats held by women in national parliament of Nepal was about 30% like that of in 2016, 2015 and 2014. In 2013, proportion of seats held by women in Nepal’s national parliament was 33.2%. </span>



### **More women are head of households** 

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost one out of every three households in Nepal is headed by a female. Evidence strongly suggests that this trend is a result of migration as most migrants are male and family heads.</span>



### <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>Women&#8217;s literacy rate has increased </strong></em></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1991, only 17% of Nepali women (15 years or older) were literate. In 2015, almost 57% of women were literate. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Education is the most important way to empower women. In last quarter century, women&#8217;s literacy rate has increased almost three times. There is still a long way to go when all women of Nepal will be literate. </span>
