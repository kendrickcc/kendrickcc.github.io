  <strong>Code for Nepal Runs Digital Empowerment Training for Women</strong>
</p>

<p class="Normal1">
  <em>Non-profit initiative seeks to train more women in digital skills to expand their professional opportunities<!-- more --></em>
</p>

<p class="Normal1">
  <strong>Kathmandu, NEPAL</strong>: Code for Nepal, a U.S.-based initiative working to increase open data and digital skills in Nepal, especially for women, will run a Digital Empowerment Training for women from July 21 to August 1, 2014, at Wigan and Leigh College in Kathmandu. Twenty young women are expected to attend the two-week training, where they will learn from some of Nepal’s top journalists, social media strategists, and entrepreneurs. Guest lecturers for the workshop include: Amit Agrawal, CEO of Janaki Technology Pvt. Ltd; Rajneesh Bhandari, multimedia journalist; Jemima Sherpa, blogger; and Pranika Koya, writer and activist, among others. Students will gain valuable digital skills during the program, including social media management, blogging, and coding.

  The 20 young women applied to attend the training in order to boost their digital skills, noting in their applications that they were especially interested in coding and using the Internet for their career growth. One woman wrote for her application that she was “keen to bring forward the female part of population to contribute to the development of the nation.”
</p>

<p class="Normal1">
  The training was designed based on a nationwide survey that Code for Nepal conducted in June and July of this year to better understand what women are interested in learning about computers and the Internet. More than 200 women took the survey, which was conducted online and offline. The Digital Empowerment Training in Kathmandu this month incorporates their input and comes at a key time for women in Nepal. As Ravi Kumar, Code for Nepal Co-Founder, puts it: “Digitally empowering young women will be key to tackling challenges such as gender-based violence and slow economic growth in Nepal.”
