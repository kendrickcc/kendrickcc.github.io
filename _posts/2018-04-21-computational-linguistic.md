Recently, Code for Nepal supported the [Himalayan Computational Linguistic Olympiad Nepal (HLON)](http://hlon.org), which is simply a computational linguistic competition. The competition happened in March in Kathmandu.

8 teams from various schools and colleges participated in the competition.Â About 80 people including the participants, volunteers, organizers, sponsors, and observers attended the event.
