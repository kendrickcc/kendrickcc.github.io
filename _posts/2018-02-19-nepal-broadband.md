Nepal provides the cheapest broadband in South Asia, with an average cost of USD 19.16 per month.

Access to the internet is considered a basic necessity in the 21st century. When people have internet they can access information, looks for jobs or access health or financial information to make better decisions about their lives.

[A new study that looked](https://www.cable.co.uk/media-centre/release/new-worldwide-broadband-price-league-unveiled/) at the average cost of broadband in 196 countries found that Iran provides the cheapest broadband.

Based on the same [study](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oH5Ham4Yn8x80ma0j_Z5SnOcQyUIsbPtzmcc0fvUEeI/edit#gid=1296416767), Nepal offers the cheapest broadband in South Asia.
