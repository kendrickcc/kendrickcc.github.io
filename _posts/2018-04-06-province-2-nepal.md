<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Province 2 has the highest number of multidimensionally poor Nepalis. </strong></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 2.5 million people are multidimensionally poor in Province 2, representing 35% of all poor Nepalis according to the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)</span>](http://npc.gov.np/images/category/Nepal_MPI.pdf) <span style="font-weight: 400;">released by the Nepali Government.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike traditional poverty rates which look at monetary indicators, the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Multidimensional Poverty Index</span>](http://npc.gov.np/images/category/Nepal_MPI.pdf) <span style="font-weight: 400;">looks at ten indicators, including child mortality, years of schooling, school attendance, nutrition, cooking fuel, improved sanitation, improved drinking water, electricity, asset ownership and flooring and roofing. If a Nepali is deprived in at least three of these areas, then she/he is considered poor.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nepal’s Multidimensional Poverty Index is aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. Overall, 28.6% of Nepal’s population is multidimensionally poor.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the report: “</span>**Provinces 6 and 2 have the highest rate of multidimensional poverty – with every second person being multidimensionally poor (50%)** <span style="font-weight: 400;">– followed by Provinces 5 and 7 (approximately 30%).”</span>



&nbsp;

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Province 2 has the highest percentage of illiterate men and women in Nepal.</strong></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One-third of men aged 6 or over in Province 2 haven’t received any education.</span>



<span style="font-weight: 400;">More than half of women aged 6 or over in Province 2 haven’t received any education.  </span>



<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Spousal violence is the highest in Province 2.</strong></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One in three women in the Terai reported spousal violence.  Women in Province 2 (37%) are most likely to experience spousal physical, sexual, or emotional violence in Nepal.</span>



<span style="font-weight: 400;">Women living in “Province 2 (33%) and Province 7 (34%) are most likely to have attitudes justifying wife beating under any one specific circumstance.”</span>

What do you think? Are you surprised? What can be done to improve the status of province 2?
