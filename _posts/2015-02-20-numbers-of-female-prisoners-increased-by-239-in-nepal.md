In the last 8 years, the number of women prisoners increased by more than 230%. That’s shockingly a lot. We are not sure why that’s happening. We do know that recently <a href="http://www.ekantipur.com/2015/01/08/national/prison-inmates-forced-to-sleep-in-plastic-sheds/400055.html" target="_blank">prison inmates were forced to sleep in plastic sheds</a> and that <a href="http://www.ekantipur.com/2014/12/11/national/inmates-forced-to-live-under-open-sky-at-dadeldhura-prison/398862.html" target="_blank">inmates are forced to live under open sky at the Dadeldhura prison</a> in Nepal.



Do you have any idea why this is happening? Tell us in the comments or tweet at us <a href="http://twitter.com/codefornepal" target="_blank">@codefornepal</a>

To give you more context, number of prisoners is increasing overall as well. Between 2001 and 2010, number of total prisoners almost doubled. See below.
