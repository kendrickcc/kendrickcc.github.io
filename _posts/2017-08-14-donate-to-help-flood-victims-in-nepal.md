Heavy monsoon floods across southern Nepal have [killed 91 people](http://www.recordnepal.com/live-blog/2017-nepal-floods-live-blog/), destroyed over 3000 homes, and displaced thousands of Nepalis. At least [six million](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/08/floods-landslides-kill-dozens-nepal-india-170813132206327.html) people are affected by the floods in the southern plains of Nepal.

Weather forecasters have predicted more rain in some areas. Scores of people reported are still missing, and over 48,000 homes flooded. Electricity and phone service have been cut off, making relief effort harder for volunteers. Nepal Red Cross warned that shortages of drinking water and food could create a [humanitarian crisis](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/08/floods-landslides-kill-dozens-nepal-india-170813132206327.html).

We need funds to support victims with relief. Flood survivors immediately need food, safe drinking water, first aid, temporary shelter and toilet and care package for women and children. Please chip in to fund our campaign. We are closely working with [volunteers](https://www.facebook.com/samarthahelpline/) on the ground to bring support directly to the victims.

As always, Code for Nepal team will maintain transparency and accountability.  
Your generous contribution will be appreciated.

*The amount raised here includes the funds raised via our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/donate/1922137254726047/) as well.*
