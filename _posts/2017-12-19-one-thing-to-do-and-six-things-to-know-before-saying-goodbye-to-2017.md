<span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope you had a great year and are enjoying the holiday season. As 2017 comes to an end, we wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for supporting Code for Nepal, seek </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">end of year donations</span>](https://codefornepal.org/donate/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, and share updates on our work over the past year. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, we undertook the following initiatives:  </span>

**Diversity and Women in Tech Scholarship**<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>:</strong> This year we launched two scholarships programs. One focuses on providing scholarships to </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">young women to learn coding</span>](https://codefornepal.org/2017/01/code-for-nepal-launches-scholarship-program-to-empower-women-in-nepal/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">. Meet </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">one of the recipients</span>](https://codefornepal.org/2017/06/1720/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">. Another program provided scholarships to a </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">diverse group of young women and men</span>](https://codefornepal.org/2017/06/tech-scholarship/)<span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1519446934782119&set=a.183982121661947.46792.100001504808045&type=3&theater">Check out a photo of the recipients</a>.</span></span></span>

**[Digital Nepal](http://digitalnepal.org/) Conference:** <span style="font-weight: 400;">Early in 2017, we organized the first-ever digital conference in Janakpur to empower young women and men. Code for Nepal founders used gifts </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">from their wedding to organize the conference</span>](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/Voices/2017/03/16/Couple-use-wedding-to-fight-brain-drain-in-Nepal/6211489668666/?spt=su&or=btn_fb/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">. Over 100 participants and speakers spent a day interacting and sharing information. We also supported a </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">digital literacy project</span>](https://codefornepal.org/2017/01/digital-literacy-center-in-janakpur/)<span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Janakpur.</span></span></span>

**[Honored by Forbes](http://www.bit.ly/c4nforbes):** <span style="font-weight: 400;">We are honored and humbled to be named in </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Forbes 30 Under 30’s list of social entrepreneurs in Asia</span>](http://www.bit.ly/c4nforbes)<span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></span></span>

**[Breathe Freely](https://codefornepal.org/en/2017/11/1952/) project:** <span style="font-weight: 400;">Nepal has one highest levels of air pollution in the world. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To start having an evidence-based conversation surrounding air pollution so that action can be taken, we launched a survey and published the results on </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nepali Times</span>](http://nepalitimes.com/article/Nepali-Times-Buzz/air-pollution-survey-kathmandu,3998)<span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">.<br /> </span></span></span>********

**[NepalMap](https://nepalmap.org):**** **<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, we launched </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">https://nepalmap.org</span>](https://nepalmap.org)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, to put Nepal&#8217;s data at your fingertips! People have visited NepalMap more than 200,000 times. In 2017, we added many new datasets such as natural disasters, foreign aid, and health indicators. Check it out if you haven’t yet.<br /> </span>****

**Supporting Flood Survivors in Nepal:** <span style="font-weight: 400;">At least six million people were affected by the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">floods in the southern plains</span>](https://codefornepal.org/2017/08/nepalflood/) <span style="font-weight: 400;">of Nepal. We raised </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">funds</span>](https://codefornepal.org/2017/08/donate-to-help-flood-victims-in-nepal/) <span style="font-weight: 400;">to help </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 600 families with initial relief</span>](https://www.facebook.com/codefornepal/posts/718086448400606)<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this would not have been possible without your help! To help us increase our impact, we ask that you consider making a </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">tax-deductible donation</span>](https://codefornepal.org/donate/) <span style="font-weight: 400;">to Code for Nepal, supporting our work to increase digital literacy and the use of open data in Nepal. We are an all-volunteer organization and every dollar will go a long way! </span>
