We know that when a woman is educated, her whole family is educated. Nations, societies and families depend on women for almost everything in life. But when we talk about the access to new opportunities, women always fall behind men. For example, in Nepal, many women don’t have access to the Internet, among many other things.<!-- more -->I am a woman and it hurts to see that we don’t have access to opportunities that men have. We are always behind men, not only when we want access to opportunities but also when we have to talk about freedom, empowerment and rights.

But we can change that. Today’s world depends on the Internet. I know that when we have access to the Internet and have digital skills, we have more opportunities to express ourselves.

My target is to introduce the digital world to 10 professional working women who already are seen as an ideal in their community. They are well aware of the necessity of modern world but due to lack of knowledge they are struggling to contribute to their society in more efficient way.

These women know that there is Facebook and other social media platform. I want to train them how to use to digital tools in a professional capacity. Let me share a story of one woman I’ll be training soon.

Mrs. Puspa Gharti Magar is working as a Monitoring and Evaluation Officer in BASE where she helps community level people to develop concepts for cooperative ways of development and assist them to do the same in villages. She is a great women making a huge difference in rural life but she still faces problems when she has to explain her work to the greater mass. The main reason behind it is not being aware to how to use digital media. What I seek with the training is to help her realize the potential of digital media and how it can help empower her.

There are other 9 participants like her participating in the training. Even I had not realized the potential of how useful these digital tools could be until I attended <a href="https://codefornepal.org/post/90988738253/digital-empowerment-training-summer-2014" target="_blank">Code for Nepal’s Digital Empowerment training</a>. A loads of thank goes to Code for Nepal not just helping me but 20 of my other fellows as well to realize our potential. Adding to that, all of 21 participants are making an effort to change the life of people around us through the knowledge gained from the training.

My training titled ‘Women Empowerment in Digital World’ is going to be conducted on 20th September, 2014 at Tulsipur, Dang. I am looking forward for it and so are my participants as well. At last, I would like to thank Code for Nepal again for funding my project, and my organization BASE and Regional Dialogue Program for supporting me through it.

Looking forward to 20th September, 2014!
