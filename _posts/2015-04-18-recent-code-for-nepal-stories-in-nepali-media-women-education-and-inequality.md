We are glad to report that in March Nepali media used some of our data visualization to publish stories about the need to educate women, education quality, and economic inequality in Nepal. Check out these stories:

  1. On the occasion of International Women’s Day on March 8, Nepali Times used our interactive map on literacy to make “districts with the best performance in child and maternal survival rates are those with the [highest rates of female literacy](https://codefornepal.org/2015/02/5-most-and-least-educated-districts-in-nepal/).&#8221; <http://nepalitimes.com/article/editorial/everyday-should-be-international-women-day,2063>
  2. Ravi, our co-founder published an op-ed on Setopati, about inequality in Nepal using our interactive map on district level poverty rates: <http://setopati.net/opinion/5816/>
  3. In March, we also published a story in Nepal about disparity in education system of Nepal: <http://nagariknews.com/society/story/34651.html>

Enjoy these stories and tell us what other stories you are interested in. We will do our best to analyze data for those stories.
