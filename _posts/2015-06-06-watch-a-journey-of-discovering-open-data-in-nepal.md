Data journalist Gyanu Sharma leads us through Kathmandu Valley to meet various stakeholders of open data, in this short documentary. In his search for the right public school for his son, we see him seeking information about the financing of public schools, a sector that is underfunded in Nepal.

Open data is new but not unheard of in Nepal. It is paving the path towards accountability.

If citizens were aware of the existence of such data that gave details on where and what the government is investing on, they could use it as a tool to demand accountability from their government.

Public schools like the one Sharma wants his son to attend could present that data to effectively advocate for more funding in order to provide quality education. The same could be done for health agencies, village development committees, and businesses.

Data will allow for a more accountable development and governance. Stout believers in the power of data like Pavitra Rana of Open Nepal hope that data will prove revolutionary.

But first, baby steps are needed. In addition to finding, creating and listing trustful detailed data about various aid or government projects, citizens also need to be more informed about the availability of such data and guidelines for effective use of that information.

Watch the documentary and tell us what you think in the comments.
