When a country is struggling on a daily basis to meet its basic needs, it&#8217;s hard to believe that over the last few decades, Nepal has made progress. Here are four charts that show how Nepal progressed. Check it out and share with others!

**In 1960, the life expectancy of an average Nepali was just a little more than 35 years. In 2015, it&#8217;s almost 70 years. Life expectancy has doubled in the last 50+ years in Nepal! **



**In 2005, only about 1 in 100 Nepalis had a subscription to a cellular mobile. In 2015, just 10 years later later, all most all Nepalis have a cellular mobile phone.** 



**In 1960, 32 out of every 100 babies born died before they turned five. In 2015, three out of every 100 babies died before they turned five. The infant mortality rate has drastically decreased. There&#8217;s still a lot of progress to make! **



**We know youth are the future of a country. In 1981, the youth literacy rate was about 30 percent. In 2015, the youth literacy rate was 90 percent. That means 9 in 10 Nepalis between ages 15 and 24 can read and write! That&#8217;s progress!**



To be clear, Nepal is still one of the poorest countries in the world. There are a lot of challenges in Nepal. These charts show that Nepal has the potential to do better!
