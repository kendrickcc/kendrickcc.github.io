[Code for Nepal](https://codefornepal.org/) is a non-profit organization that aims to increase digital literacy and access to technology in Nepal. We focus on providing training and resources for coding and data literacy, as well as advocating for policies and programs that support technology education and access. Code for Nepal also works to promote the use of technology to address social issues and improve the lives of Nepali people.

We introduced the Code for Nepal Data Fellowship in 2020, and this has been one of our success stories. Our partnership with  [DataCamp Donates](https://www.datacamp.com/donates)  enables our fellows access to an amazing learning platform that offers interactive courses in data science, analytics, and programming. Additionally, as part of the fellowship they also join a supportive community, collaborate with like-minded individuals, receive guidance from experienced mentors, and even earn an income. Fellows have the opportunity to share their knowledge and insights by writing blogs. We believe this program offers a unique chance for individuals to develop their skills and contribute to the tech industry in Nepal and globally.

Recently, we surveyed our alumni to request information regarding if the Code for Nepal partnership with DataCamp helped them kickstart their career in data.

Most of the respondents stated that DataCamp helped them to learn or enhance their programming skills, specifically in Python, SQL, and data analysis. Some respondents are students who are still learning and looking for internships, while others secured jobs or internships after completing DataCamp courses. A few respondents also mentioned that DataCamp provided them with a platform to learn about AI/ML and big data. One respondent mentioned that DataCamp has been a crucial resource for them in developing their data analysis skills, and they were able to secure a full-time position at a clinical tech company.

From the survey responses, the following companies were mentioned where participants secured jobs or internships after learning through DataCamp:  [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/),  [Fusemachines](https://fusemachines.com/),  [Cloudfactory,](https://www.cloudfactory.com/) [Cotiviti Nepal](https://www.cotiviti.com/),  [Plieger Group](https://www.plieger.nl/),  [Mediflow Solutions](https://mediflowsolutions.com/), and  [Nimble Clinical Research](https://www.nimble-cr.com/). However, some participants did not mention the companies they secured jobs/internships with or were still seeking opportunities.
