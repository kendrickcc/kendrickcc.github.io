We are raising money to give 25 scholarships to young women from diverse background to learn to code. Your contribution will make an impact, whether you donate $5 or $500. 100% of the donation will be used to provide scholarships. Every little bit helps. Thank you for your support.

Gender equality in all sectors and especially in the tech sector, in Nepal, remains a challenge. We would like to help change that. Code for Nepal has years of experience in providing opportunities for women to learn to code and finding a job or internship. Please join us in making Nepal a more equal place for women. Please donate and share with your friends and family.
