<p class="has-drop-cap">
  Overall in Nepal, inequality is low in context of the country’s economic development. <br />
</p>

Inequality is measured by the Gini Index, “the most widely used measure of inequality”. The Gini Index looks at the “distribution of a nation’s income or wealth, where 0 represents complete equality and 1 total inequality.”  


The most recent [Demographic and Health Survey](https://www.dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR336/FR336.pdf) of Nepal released by the Ministry of Health shows which provinces have the highest wealth inequality.  
  
Province 6 has the highest inequality and one of the [highest rates of multidimensional poverty](https://codefornepal.org/2018/01/province-poverty-nepal/) with every second person being multidimensionally poor (50%), the same as Province 2 of Nepal. However, inequality in Province 2 is the lowest in the country, according to the Demographic and Health Survey.
