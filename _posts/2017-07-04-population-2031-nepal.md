Have you thought about how many people there will be in your district in 10 or 15 years? Well, now you can find out.

These six districts are projected to have the **highest population** in Nepal in 2031, according to the Central Bureau Statistics of Nepal.

Kathmandu  
Rupandehi  
Morang  
Kailali  
Sunsari  
Jhapa



Kathmandu, the capital, will continue to have the highest number of residents. The other five  
districts belong to the Terai region.



Similarly, the six districts projected to have the **lowest population** in Nepal in 2031 are:

Manang  
Mustang  
Rasuwa  
Dolpa  
Humla  
Mugu

Geographically, these districts are highly mountainous and often face the challenge of a lack of infrastructure and development.
