**Code for Nepal** is pleased to support Digital Governance Hackathon 2017. The hackathon is being organized in Kathmandu, Nepal on 11-12 February 2017 at Hotel Hardik, Bagbazaar.

The aim of the hackathon is to connect software developers to government and nonprofit organizations to produce digital products around issues of Civic Engagement, Open Government and Open Data, Financial Technology, Accountability, Democratic Policy Making, Education and Health and Digital Services to Public.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The event is being hosted by American Embassy, with support from Ministry of Education, Hello Sarkar Nepal, National Federation of Disabled-Nepal(NFD-N), Federation of Nepali Journalists(FNJ), </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">MaxConnect</span>](http://home.maxconnectworld.com/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, chakrapath.com, Code For Nepal and </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Programiz</span>](https://www.programiz.com)<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hackathons are one of many initiatives going on to promote digital governance in Nepal. Code for Nepal recently released </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">nepalmap.org</span>](http://www.nepalmap.org)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, a platform to explore and understand Nepal using data. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recently partnered with Women Development Advocacy Center (WDAC), a non-profit in Nepal, to support a computer learning center in Janakpur, a town in southern borders of Nepal.</span>

We hope that the hackathon is able to provide much needed technological support to projects initiated by government and non-profits.
