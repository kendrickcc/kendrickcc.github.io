We have partnered with Women Development Advocacy Center (WDAC), a non-profit in Nepal, to support a computer learning center in Janakpur, a town in southern borders of Nepal.

The learning center will train local youth from the disadvantaged background, especially those from rural areas.

&nbsp;

At Code for Nepal, we believe in increasing digital literacy especially among women and minorities. By partnering with WDAC we are supporting the mission. We are supporting by providing the salary of a trainer who will teach youth.

We are grateful for Mitrapath, Inc, a non-profit based in the U.S. for their donations to support to this digital literacy center.
