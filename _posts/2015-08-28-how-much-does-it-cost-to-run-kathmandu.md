<span style="font-weight: 400;">This data contributed by Nikesh Balami at </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">openspending.org</span>](http://openspending.org/) <span style="font-weight: 400;">helps visualize the spending by Nepal government on the city of Kathmandu.  A similar <a href="http://np.okfn.org/">visualization</a> and analysis was done in 2013 by Open Knowledge Foundation Nepal. NRs. 2.9 billion is being prepared for Kathmandu&#8217;s public expenditure for the year 2015-2016. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a 2013 </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span>](http://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/document/SAR/nepal/ora-pfm-nepal-report.pdf) <span style="font-weight: 400;">by the Center for Public Expenditure, the budget preparation process of Nepal is inefficient and untimely. There is a lack of internal auditing process. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Researcher Chandan Sapkota’s report </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">mentions</span>](http://sapkotac.blogspot.com/2014/06/gdp-by-district-and-region-in-nepal.html) <span style="font-weight: 400;">that the city district of Kathmandu accounts for 15.8% of the total share of Nepal’s GDP.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some questions we would like to explore and welcome our readers’ help: </span>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the total income of Kathmandu metropolitan city and how much do different sectors account for? </span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">How does this compare to Pokhara, Lalitpur, Biratnagar and other cities?</span>
</li>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Accessibility of such comprehensive information with the help of the government or related organizations in the coming years would be beneficial to those trying to understand Nepal’s progress.</span>
