**Who are you and tell us how/where did you grow up?**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">My name is Pratima Kandel and I am a Sophomore majoring in Computer Science at the University of Mary Washington, Virginia. I am originally from Nepal. My hometown is in Bhaktapur, I have three sisters and a younger brother. I grew up in an era where we were in less control of social media and technology, this made me an outside person. If any time, my parents were looking for me, they would find me somewhere catching crabs in the streams or playing soccer. Yeah!! I was a tomboy. I am an adventurous person and love to do anything that involves with an adrenaline rush.  </span>

**How did you become involved with Code for Nepal?**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I was introduced to Code for Nepal through a friend. The history behind the formation of Code for Nepal and the work done by the organization was fascinating, this inspired me to become involved. </span>

**Code for Nepal is a volunteer-run organization, many of the volunteers have daytime jobs outside of Code for Nepal. Therefore, where is your passion and dedication for this organization derived from?**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning is a very crucial part of life and working with Code for Nepal is learning to me. Every project that we have done so far is challenging, it involves patience and dedication. Throughout my experience, I have learned various important qualities, which makes me a good programmer and a learner. I have always been interested in volunteering and helping my community and Code for Nepal has helped me give back to my country with the knowledge that I have gained so far. </span>

**What is your role in Code for Nepal? Do you see yourself changing this role anytime in the future?**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I started as a volunteer with Code for Nepal some months ago and presently, I feel privileged to be given the role as an Assistant developer. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I look forward to work on more projects and continue to learn from Code for Nepal. </span>

**Where do you see Code for Nepal in the next few years?** 

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital literacy and open data are very important terms that are crucial in today’s rapid technology-driven world. Countries like Nepal are in slow progress and still backward in terms of technology. I see Code for Nepal changing this ongoing problem. Through technology and open data, we could see a Modern Nepal that has highly progressed regarding Digital Literacy. </span>

**How is Code for Nepal different or special from other non-profits?** 

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Code for Nepal is a unique organization that works for spreading digital and data literacy in Nepal and builds civic technology tools such as https://nepalmap.org. As I mentioned, Nepal needs to progress in the field of technology and there is rarely much organization that involves in solving the problem that our country is facing. Thus, Code for Nepal is a welcoming organization with volunteers providing their time and effort to make a change. </span>

**How can individuals especially the youth become more aware or involved with Code for Nepal?**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Good marketing is always the first thing for making people aware of our organization. We could partner with colleges and do events. In today’s highly influential social media, we could spread our words about Code for Nepal. Lastly, continue doing our best work for our country which will eventually attract youths who are interested in making a change. </span>
