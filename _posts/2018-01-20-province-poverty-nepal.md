<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are seven newly formed provinces in Nepal. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Among them, <strong>Province 2 has the highest number of multidimensionally poor Nepalis</strong>. More than 2.5 million people are multidimensionally poor in Province 2, representing </span>35% of all poor Nepalis according to the [Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)](http://npc.gov.np/images/category/Nepal_MPI.pdf) released by the Nepali Government.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike traditional poverty rates which look at monetary indicators, the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Multidimensional Poverty Index</span>](http://npc.gov.np/images/category/Nepal_MPI.pdf) <span style="font-weight: 400;">looks at ten indicators, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">child mortality, years of schooling, school attendance, nutrition, cooking fuel, improved sanitation, improved drinking water, electricity, asset ownership and flooring and roofing. If a Nepali is deprived in at least three of these areas, then she/he is considered poor. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nepal’s Multidimensional Poverty Index is aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">28.6% of Nepal’s population is multidimensionally poor. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the report: “<strong>Provinces 6 and 2 have the highest rate of multidimensional poverty – with every second person being multidimensionally poor (50%)</strong> – followed by Provinces 5 and 7 (approximately 30%).” </span>

Look at this chart to see each province&#8217;s incidence of multidimensional poverty.



<span style="font-weight: 400;">Province 2 is the second largest province in the country. Located in southeastern Nepal, this province includes Bara, Dhanusha, Mahottari, Parsa, Rauthat, Saptari, Sarlahi and Siraha.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Province 6 is the smallest province in Nepal and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> includes the districts of Dailekh, Dolpa, Humla, Jajarkot, Jumla, Kalikot Mugu, Rukum (western part) Salyan, Surkhet.</span>

Here&#8217;s an interactive map visualizing the distribution of <span style="font-weight: 400;">multidimensional poverty in Nepal. </span>
