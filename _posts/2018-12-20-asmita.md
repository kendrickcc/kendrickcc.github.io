  <strong>Who are you and tell us how/where did you grow up? </strong><br />Born in Pokhara and raised in Kathmandu, I hold both places close to my heart. I grew up in a big joint family which included my grandparents, uncles, parents, and siblings.  Being away from home has been a challenge <g class="gr_ gr_9 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="9" data-gr-id="9">to</g> say the least. My parents instilled the importance of education and personal independence in me from an early age, so I have them to thank for who and where I am today. I realize not everyone is as privileged as I have been; therefore, working towards leveling the playing field for Nepali girls and women has always been a priority for me.

**How did you become involved with Code for Nepal?**  
I learned about a lot of cool things that Code for Nepal does through their Facebook page. As an IT professional, Code for Nepal’s mission to promote digital literacy in Nepal really resonated with me.

**Code for Nepal is a volunteer-run organization, many of the volunteers have daytime jobs outside of Code for Nepal. Therefore, where is your passion and dedication for this organization derived from?**  
Opportunity should be indiscriminate, not based on gender or social class, as it is so often in Nepal. Digital literacy is a powerful tool that can enforce this principle by empowering Nepali women and girls, which is why I chose to work with this organization. 

**What is your role in Code for Nepal? Do you see yourself changing this role anytime in the future?**  
I was previously a Scholarship Manager at Code for Nepal, and helped raise scholarship funds for web design courses for Nepali girls who were interested in learning web development. Recently, I took on the role of Director of Strategy. I intend to support the organization by managing the various projects that make Code for Nepal impactful.

**Where do you see Code for Nepal in the next few years and what can it do to improve?**  
I think Code for Nepal will continue its great work by bringing together like-minded, proponents of digital literacy. In a few years’ time, I hope our work will have have increased in both scale and reach. 

**How is Code for Nepal different or special from other non-profits?  
** I think Code for Nepal’s work in mobilizing youth in the country to promote the merits of <g class="gr_ gr\_10 gr-alert gr\_gramm gr\_inline\_cards gr\_disable\_anim_appear Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="10" data-gr-id="10">technology,</g> and support various avenues they pursue to spread digital literacy is quite special. We work with many extremely passionate young adults and <g class="gr_ gr\_202 gr-alert gr\_spell gr\_inline\_cards gr\_run\_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="202" data-gr-id="202">expreience</g> professionals, who constantly inspire me with their enthusiasm and dedication. Some of them are working to create change in their own home districts, so the projects our volunteers initiate and lead are not only impactful but also highly personal.
