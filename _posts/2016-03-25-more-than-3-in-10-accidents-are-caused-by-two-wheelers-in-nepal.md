Yesterday Code for Nepal <a href="https://codefornepal.org/en/2016/03/1157/" target="_blank">published a chart</a> on who causes the most road accidents in Nepal.

Today here&#8217;s a chart I created that has which type of vehicles cause the most accidents? I&#8217;m sure it is easy to guess?

It&#8217;s Two Wheelers. Yes, no surprises there! Sadly.

We looked at a report published by Nepal Police in 2015 to see what causes most accidents in Nepal. More than 3 in 10 accidents in Nepal are caused by two wheelers in Nepal, according to the data published by Nepal Police.

“Data covers the range of July, 2014 to June 2015, provided & verified by PHQ Traffic Directorate.”

There were over 8,700 accidents in Nepal between July 2014 and June 2015. Over 5,403 were caused by Two Wheelers. The lowest number of accidents is 203 caused is by tempo-three wheeler. Check out the chart below to see what else caused accidents.
