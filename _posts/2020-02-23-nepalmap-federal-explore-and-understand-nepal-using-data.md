Code for Nepal has just launched the federal version of [NepalMap](https://nepalmap.org/), a web app that puts data about Nepal at your fingertips! Since 2016, this data portal has been the go-to source for many journalists, researchers, entrepreneurs and students; when they are looking for data or data visualizations. 

After the promulgation of 2015 constitution and adoption of federal structure, we see demand for data has increased. Data users have been continuously searching for data from aligned with the new federal structure which includes 753 local bodies, 77 districts and 7 provinces.

To meet the demand of users, with the help of generous support of our volunteers, we are happy to launch the federal version of NepalMap &#8211; <https://nepalmap.org/>.

Whether you live in Province 1 or anywhere else in Nepal, you can find out how many people live in your Province or District or Municipality. Or find out what kind of crops or vegetables farmers produce in the area where you live. On this version of NepalMap, demographics, agriculture, educational and household data are available.

NepalMap uses [National Data Profile](http://nationaldata.gov.np/), created by [Central Bureau of Statistics](http://www.cbs.gov.np/), and other official sources, to create user-friendly data visualizations on key demographic issues. You can embed, access or download the data too. You can also compare any two areas side-by-side.

NepalMap is based on [Wazimap](https://github.com/Code4SA/wazimap) which is a fork of [Census Reporter](https://censusreporter.org/). Wazimap is built and maintained by [Code for South Africa](http://code4sa.org/). All of these tools are completely open source. You can build [one](https://wazimap.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) for your country.

NepalMap is entirely built by [volunteers](https://github.com/Code4Nepal/nepalmap_federal/graphs/contributors) who are committed to ensuring everyone has access to open data about Nepal. We are looking for volunteers who can help us add more data, and improve NepalMap. If you have the right skills, and would like to help, please complete this [form](http://codefornepal.org/en/help/) or you can also directly create issues in our GitHub repo to report the bug. If you would like to access pre-federal data from 2011 Population Census, please check out: <https://2011.nepalmap.org/>. 

Code for Nepal is grateful to Clifton McIntosh for his guidance throughout the development process; Amit Chaudhary, Nitesh Rijal, Pratima Kandel, Ishan Dangol for their code contribution and Nirmal Rijal for helping us with data scraping.
