# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that.
# This file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use 'bundle exec jekyll serve'.
# If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

description: >-
  Aerial photography, videography and photogrammetry services covering Missouri. Based out of Columbia, MO, I've traveled all over the state capturing
  standard commercial locations and real estate. I also capture photogrammetry type missions to measure stock piles of material, compositing orthomosaics,
  and building 3D objects. My drones are the DJI Mavic 3 platform: Mavic 3 Pro and Mavic 3 Pro Cine and the Mavic 3 Enterprise with RTK which can achieve
  centimeter level accuracy.
