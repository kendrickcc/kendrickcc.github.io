      Chris Kendrick Photography launched in 2020 when Chris decided to change careers and focus primarily on photography. Received their FAA Part 107 certificate and immediately 
      found work flying corn, soybean and cotton fields for crop scouting. We expanded into real estate photography to include interior photography in addition to exterior
      photographs. In 2022 and 2023 Chris Kendrick Photography was hired to fly crops for Taranis. Over those two years, we flew over 100,000 acres mostly in North Missouri and a small
      area in Southwest Kansas. We began to work on video projects such as documentaries, commercials and events.
